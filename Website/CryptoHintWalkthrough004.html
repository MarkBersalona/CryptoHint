          'EVERY blank, WHOEVER blank, NEEDS A something something' sound
          possible. KVQWNWO might also be HOWEVER - 'EVERY blank, HOWEVER
          blank, NEEDS A something something' sounds even better. I'll try
          HOWEVER first, hold off on NEEDS for the moment.

          Ummm, when I filled in NEEDS and MOST, the N in what would have been
          VANITY didn't fill in, so NCBPGU must be something else. And the
          author's name starts with a D instead of a P, that is, if NEEDS is
          correct. Maybe it's KEEPS instead of NEEDS, there's no other instance
          of N in the cryptogram. I'll back out the N and D in NEEDS.

          Good, the author's name got filled in with all that. Logan Pearsall
          Smith: according to Wikipedia, an American-born essayist and critic.
          American-born, not American? Born in Millville, NJ, 1865, died 1946,
          ah, grew up in part in England and became a British citizen in 1913.
