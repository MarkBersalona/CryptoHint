        </h1>
        <p>
          The idea for <strong>CryptoHint</strong> was inspired by online tools
          designed to solve cryptograms. At first I was going to create an
          iPhone app to solve cryptograms, but realized attempting to type in
          an entire cryptogram consisting of apparently randomized letters
          would be a chore; besides that, the fun of solving a cryptogram is
          eliminated by a tool that does it for you. It is better to have
          <strong>a tool to <em>help</em> solve a cryptogram but not do
          everything for you,</strong> and typing in one word at a time
          wouldn't be so bad. There are cryptogram dictionaries that exist in
          book form, though an Internet search only found one, published in
          2007, and its wordlist is somewhat limited. Despite comments I've
          found online that a programmer could easily write a program to
          generate a list of cryptogram letter patterns, I didn't find anything
          remotely like it in the iPhone App Store. And in the user reviews for
          one of the cryptogram puzzle apps, a reviewer mentioned a nice
          feature to have would be to look up words that would match a
          cryptogram's letter pattern. It seemed obvious there could be a
          market for an app that could do such lookups.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of the list of recent cryptogram words came after
          testing an earlier version of CryptoHint against real cryptograms and
          crypto family puzzles. At the start of a given puzzle a word might
          have an excessively long list of matches and I'd try other words in
          the puzzle; I'd eventually need to reenter the previous word after a
          while, which could be a pain. I thought, <strong>'Why can't the app
          remember what I tried earlier so I don't need to retype it?'</strong>
          So I added the feature and saved a lot of retyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of picker wheels to specify letter substitution pairs
          eliminates the drudgery of having two text fields for the letter
          pairs, parsing to account for multiple letter entries, punctuation,
          numeric digits, checks for letters already used, and so on. Again,
          saves a lot of typing. Afterwards I found a cryptogram puzzle app
          that does the same thing with picker wheels, so it's not an original
          idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          CryptoHint uses <strong>Courier</strong> and <strong>Marker
          Felt</strong> fonts to differentiate between cryptogram ciphertext
          and solution plaintext wherever possible. When I started learning how
          to solve cryptograms by hand so many years ago I'd solve the
          cryptograms in the newspaper by writing the solution directly
          underneath the printed puzzle. Courier is the closest to what appears
          in newspaper cryptogram puzzles, and Marker Felt is the only
          available font on the iPhone that has a handlettered look. For the
          display of the substitution map, I had to make do with Courier in
          italics since Marker Felt is not a monospaced font.

        <p>
          One 'nice to have' feature would be the ability to type in a
          cryptogram and have its letters replaced with the solution as the
          substitution map is filled in. The major difficulty is the difficulty
          of typing all those encrypted letters on an iPhone virtual keyboard
          without errors. A minor difficulty would be finding available screen
          space.
