          <em>I know what you mean.</em> Part of the challenge in solving
          puzzles is to do it unassisted. Looking up words in a dictionary,
          taking advantage of any clues or hints that might be provided,
          peeking at the solution quickly - these detract from the satisfaction
          of solving the puzzle. Taking it to the extreme, if you gave a puzzle
          to a magic machine that solved the puzzle for you, where's the fun in
          that?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You can think of CryptoHint as a training tool.</strong> It
          certainly helped me. When I was developing and testing CryptoHint, it
          had been years since I last solved a cryptogram puzzle in the
          newspaper, and at first I was very rusty. The first several
          cryptograms I tried solving were difficult for me, and I used
          CryptoHint for many words in each cryptogram. But with further
          practice I started recognizing letter and word patterns again, and
          needed CryptoHint less often. Soon I was solving most cryptograms
          without CryptoHint at all.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- ###################################################################### -->
      <div class="column2">
        <p>
          In fact I now have the opposite problem of not needing CryptoHint
          when I DO want to use it! For CryptoHint's website I started writing
          cryptogram walkthroughs: solving a cryptogram by example; another way
          to put it might be solving a cryptogram with full commentary. I
          wanted to show some examples of how helpful CryptoHint could be with
          difficult cryptograms. After a dozen walkthroughs, however, I've been
          able to solve the cryptograms without using CryptoHint.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a dictionary, CryptoHint can also be used as a training tool in
          pattern recognition. When you start learning how to solve
          cryptograms, you're told about the letter patterns of some common
          words. RFNIN, a 5-letter word with the third and fifth letters
          identical, is often THERE or WHERE; CryptoHint finds 460 other words
          that match the pattern, such as THESE, PIECE and BASIS. (It finds all
          462 matching words as long as the letter substitution map is clear.)
          GIRNI, we are told, is usually WHICH, and perhaps in cryptograms
          WHICH is the most common; CryptoHint however finds many other common
          words like SERVE, LEAVE and FENCE which also fit the pattern. If I
          enter my last name, CryptoHint finds 571 matches, like EXPANSION,
          CHRISTMAS and LITHESOME.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then there is the "wisdom" as the "prize" for solving cryptogram
          puzzles. Most cryptograms are quotations or words of wisdom. As a
          counter-example, a sudoku puzzle is a grid of numbers. If you "cheat"
          and use a "SudokuHint" app to solve a sudoku puzzle, what do you get
          in the end? A grid of numbers. If you're really stuck and use
          CryptoHint to solve a cryptogram, you might not get bragging rights
          for solving the puzzle unaided, but <em>you're a little wiser</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Using CryptoHint isn't cheating - it's training and
          learning.</strong> You'll get better at solving cryptograms with
          practice: the more cryptograms you solve with or without CryptoHint,
          the better you'll get at recognizing letter and word patterns; you
          won't need CryptoHint as often.
