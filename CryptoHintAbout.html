              The idea for <strong>CryptoHint</strong> was inspired by online
              tools designed to solve cryptograms. At first I was going to
              create an iPhone app to solve cryptograms, but realized
              attempting to type in an entire cryptogram consisting of
              apparently randomized letters would be a chore; besides that, the
              fun of solving a cryptogram is eliminated by a tool that does it
              for you. It is better to have <strong>a tool to <em>help</em>
              solve a cryptogram but not do everything for you,</strong> and
              typing in a word at a time wouldn't be so bad. There are
              cryptogram dictionaries that exist in book form, though an
              Internet search only found one, published in 2007, and its
              wordlist is somewhat limited. Despite comments I've found online
              that a programmer could easily write a program to generate a list
              of cryptogram letter patterns, I didn't find anything remotely
              like it in the iPhone App Store. And in the user reviews for one
              of the cryptogram puzzle apps, a reviewer mentioned a nice
              feature to have would be to look up words that would match a
              cryptogram's letter pattern. It seemed obvious there could be a
              market for an app that could do such lookups.
            </p>
            <p>
              The addition of the list of recent cryptogram words came after
              testing an earlier version of CryptoHint against real cryptograms
              and crypto family puzzles. At the start of a given puzzle a word
              might have an excessively long list of matches and I'd try other
              words in the puzzle; I'd eventually need to reenter the previous
              word after a while, which could be a pain. I thought,
              <strong>'Why can't the app remember what I tried earlier so I
              don't need to retype it?'</strong> So I added the feature and
              saved a lot of retyping.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of picker wheels to specify letter substitution pairs
              eliminates the drudgery of having two text fields for the letter
              pairs, parsing to account for multiple letter entries,
              punctuation, numeric digits, checks for letters already used, and
              so on. Again, saves a lot of typing. Afterwards I found a
              cryptogram puzzle app that does the same thing with picker
              wheels, so it's not an original idea.

              CryptoHint uses <strong>Courier</strong> and <strong>Marker
              Felt</strong> fonts to differentiate between cryptogram
              ciphertext and solution plaintext wherever possible. When I
              started learning how to solve cryptograms by hand so many years
              ago I'd solve the cryptograms in the newspaper by writing the
              solution directly underneath the printed puzzle. Courier is the
              closest to what appears in newspaper cryptogram puzzles, and
              Marker Felt is the only available font on the iPhone that has a
              handlettered look. For the display of the substitution map, I had
              to make do with Courier in italics since Marker Felt is not a
              monospaced font.
