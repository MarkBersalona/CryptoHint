<li>When trying to solve a cryptogram, start with the longest words with any repeating letters - the list of matching words should be relatively short and the word will be good for many letters for the letter substitution map, which will narrow the search for subsequent words.
</li>
<li>If a cryptogram word search finds no matches, make sure you've typed the word correctly. If there were no typos, there's probably a bad guess in the letter substitution map.
</li>
<li>A single-letter cryptogram word is either A or I; very rarely it is O.</li>
<li>The wordlist includes some proper names like LINCOLN, SHAKESPEARE and ANONYMOUS, try the author's name if it's included in the cryptogram.
